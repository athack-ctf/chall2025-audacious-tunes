# Chall - Audacious Tunes

> Here's a .wav file we found while digging around Jester's hard drives, it Appears to be a snippet from his "World Domination" playlist however something doesn't seem right... We aren't sure what to do with it but perhaps you could find some more information if you had a listen.

## Description

A simple audio-steganography challenge. My intentions for this challenge were to further the story, as it seems to revolve around Jester's voice with the grand reveal at the end of the film, while also creating a challenge geared towards beginner/intermediate level @hack members. The main challenge I foresee members encountering with my challenge is being unaware of spectogram analysis, for this reason I included a small hint in the title of the challenge: 'Audacious AI' to guide participants towards using the Audacity app, which is half the challenge complete, in my opinion.

**IMPORTANT:** This description will **NOT** be shared with participants.

# Project Structure

## 1. HACKME.md

- **[HACKME.md](HACKME.md)**: A teaser or description of the challenge to be shared with participants (in CTFd).

## 2. Source Code

- **[source/README.md](source/README.md)**: Sufficient instructions for building your offline artifacts from source
  code. If your project includes multiple subprojects, please consult us (Anis and Hugo).
- **[source/*](source/)**: Your source code.

## 3. Offline Artifacts

- **[offline-artifacts/*](offline-artifacts/)**: All files (properly named) intended for local download by
  participants (e.g., a binary executable for reverse engineering, a custom-encoded image, etc.). For large files (
  exceeding 100 MB), please consult us (Anis and Hugo).

## 4. Solution

- **[solution/README.md](solution/README.md)**: A detailed writeup of the working solution.
- **[solution/FLAGS.md](solution/FLAGS.md)**: A single markdown file listing all (up-to-date) flags.
- **[solution/*](solution/)**: Any additional files or code necessary for constructing a reproducible solution for the
  challenge (e.g., `PoC.py`, `requirement.txt`, etc.).
