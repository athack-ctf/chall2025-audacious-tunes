## Description

A simple audio-steganography challenge. My intentions for this challenge were to further the story, as it seems to revolve around Jester's voice with the grand reveal at the end of the film, while also creating a challenge geared towards beginner/intermediate level @hack members. The main challenge I foresee members encountering with my challenge is being unaware of spectogram analysis, for this reason I included a small hint in the title of the challenge: 'Audacious AI' to guide participants towards using the Audacity app, which is half the challenge complete, in my opinion.

**IMPORTANT:** This description will **NOT** be shared with participants.
