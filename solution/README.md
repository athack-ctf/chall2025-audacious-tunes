# How to Solve the Challenge?

Provide reproducible steps to solve the challenge. This can include:

1. Open the .wav file found in offline-artifacts in Audacity. (Other software can be used to solve this challenge as long as it allows spectogram viewing of .wav files)
2. Switch view to spectogram

3. Zoom in to see the flag hidden in the spectogram view during the first 2 seconds. (Depending on the length of the final audio track zooming in may not be necessary)

Ensure that all dependencies required to build or run the solution are provided (e.g., `requirements.txt`) or thoroughly documented.
